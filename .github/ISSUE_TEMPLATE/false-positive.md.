The tool has flagged an assignment as ineffectual, but you think it is wrong.  The burden is on you to show where the assignment is used.  (Hint: the tool is time-tested and unlikely to report false positives.  More likely, you've misunderstood your code.)

Please provide enough code to reproduce the issue and a clear indication of which variable is assigned and on which line.
